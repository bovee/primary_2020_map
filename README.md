## Introduction
This is a little playground to see if I can successfully map the entirety of the 2020 state senate primary which is split between San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.

All of the data processing and mapping work occurs in `plot_elec_results.py`.

## Todo
 - Maybe this should just be a Jupyter notebook?
